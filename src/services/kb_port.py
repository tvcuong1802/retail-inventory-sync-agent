"""Knowledge-base loading — bundled data only, for now.

The template ships its own knowledge data and always uses it. There is deliberately
no operator-supplied channel yet: how an adopting organisation plugs in its own data
is a platform-level convention, and defining it is CoE's call, not one template's.
Inventing a private convention here would mean sixty templates each inventing a
different one, and all sixty needing rework once the real one lands.

What this module does provide is the seam. `load_kb` already returns *where* the data
came from, so the day a channel exists it is one branch in one function rather than a
change spread across every node that reads knowledge data.

The origin travels with the data on purpose. A template quietly running on its own
sample data looks exactly like one running on real data — that indistinguishability
is the whole failure this work is about, so callers surface `describe()` in the
output rather than letting the reader assume.

── When the channel arrives ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Constraints already measured, so whoever wires it does not rediscover them:

  * The Admin console offers environment variables only — no file upload, no volume,
    no configmap. The Pod's filesystem holds what the image holds, nothing else.
  * Values must be read through `ctx.secrets` / the SecretProvider, never
    `os.environ` directly (README §Initialization; the framework contract).
  * ORDER: `register_nodes()` hands each node its own copy of the data at
    `compile()` time — verified by running it, a reload afterwards leaves the nodes
    on the old copy. (Wheel 1.0.3 provisions secrets BEFORE compile; earlier wheels
    did the reverse. Either way the copy is taken at compile.) So a provider-sourced
    KB is not just a change to this function: the consuming nodes must read lazily
    too. Worth raising with CoE when the channel is designed, because it constrains
    any mechanism that arrives after compile time.
  * An env var carries ~32KB comfortably (measured against this template's own
    pattern set). A RAG-scale corpus does not fit, and no channel for one exists.

The shape it would take:

    raw = ctx.secrets.get(env_var(name))      # what the operator configured
    if raw:
        return KB(_parse(raw), "configured", name)
    return KB(_parse(bundled_path.read_text()), "bundled", name)
