"""PB — the model is on the live invoke path, and its answer reaches the reader.

Buoc 0d asks three things of a template: that a client EXISTS, that it RUNS, and that it
sits where it adds something. Static analysis answers only the first. This file answers
the second, and it is the artefact `llm-live-path-untested` demands.

Copy this file verbatim into `tests/unit/test_llm_live_path.py` and fill the two markers
at the bottom. Keep everything above them byte-identical fleet-wide: the whole point is
that one patch fixes every repo, verified with sha256, the same mechanism as kb_port.py.

Two things this pins that a naive version does not:

1. **The call count alone is vacuously green.** A client can be built, called, and then
   ignored by the branch that produces the answer -- which reads as success and costs
   money for nothing. So the degraded output is compared too: if answering with a model
   and answering without one produce the same text, the model is decoration.

2. **BaseGraph.invoke() does NOT bind the secrets ContextVar.** The Marketplace runner
   does, at marketplace_app.py:144 (`with bound_secrets(...)`). A test that skips that
   binding makes every repo whose client comes from the shared llm_provider.py look like
   it never calls the model, because InvocationContext.from_state() then sees a
   NullProvider, require() raises, and build_llm_client() swallows it and returns None.
   Measured 2026-08-27: four repos looked broken and none of them were.
